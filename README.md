I created this website to remind us to blink our eyes.

We spend a lot of time at the computer, and we don't blink often and this is very harmful. Then this website will help you remember to blink and maintain good vision health.

To-Do List: 

* [X] - Create and edit the HTML file;
* [X] - Create and edit the CSS file;
* [X] - Create button using bootstrap;
* [X] - Use library Howler to play sounds;
* [X] - Add play / stop in the same button;
* [X] - Add a volume bar;
* [ ] - Add more sounds, so the user can choose (maybe);
